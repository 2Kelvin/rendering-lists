In this read, I learnt to:
- move data out of components and into data structures like arrays & objects
- use javascript array methods `filter()` & `map()` 
- manipulate array data and display similar components from an array using map()
- map(): it creates a `<li>` item out of every item in the array
- filter(): it lets you select particular items from the array that meet your search & you can then use map() on this filtered array to display the list items. Basically , it lets you filter the data you want
- create keys in the item's data and use it in react to uniquelly identify it incase any changes occur to it or the array
