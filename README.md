In this read, I learnt to:
- mainpulate array data and display similar components from an array
- use javascript array methods `filter()` & `map()` methods
- map() creates a <li> item out of every item in the array
- filter() lets you select particular items from the array that meet your search & using map(), displays them as <li> items. Basically , it lets filter the data you want.
